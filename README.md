# Reproducibility-in-ML
### Abstract
In this project, we worked on reproducibility in machine learning. We used the paper Visual
Transformers: Token-based Image Representation and Processing for Computer Vision [Wu et al.,
2020], which discusses the use of visual tokens for image classification problems. We tried to
reproduce some of the experiments performed in the paper to see if we can achieve similar results. We
were able to test the effect of various numbers of tokens. We did not quite achieve the same results
as the paper, most likely due to the lack of computing power that the Google Colab platform has.
Finally, we performed some more tests to analyze the robustness of the ViTResNet model presented
in the paper.  

This project was conducted in a group of 3 during the COMP 551 class at McGill University.
